### Frontend Testing

At present our frontend is only manually tested due to time constraints and a late decision to move to JavaScript/JSON API. Future iterations of the project would include testing these aspects to ensure full functionality and consistent user experience.

### Backend Testing

Backend fully unit tested using JUnit4
